# CLIP-Combiner-Composed-Image-Retrieval

In this repo, I post a simple demo to retrieve fashion image from a reference query and a text that includes a descriptive request from the user about the image.

In this work, I use OpenAI's CLIP model to extract features from image and text and combine them by a neural network introduced in CLIP4Cir paper.
